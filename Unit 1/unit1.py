    # This object represents a universe where dark energy dominates (Omega_lambda = 1.0),
    # and there's no matter (Omega_m = 0). This universe is expected to expand forever at
    # an accelerating rate due to the influence of dark energy.

    # This cosmology object represents a flat universe (Omega_m + Omega_lambda = 1.0),
    # where dark energy and matter contribute equally to the overall density.

    # In this model, matter dominates the universe, and there is no dark energy.

    # is less than 1, giving Omega_k > 0. Such a universe expands forever, but at a decreasing rate.
